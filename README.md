## Abstract

Here it goes the abstract of the slides. I show here how to setup this template, basic syntax for creating the content, and some `JS` macros.

## Take home messages

- Start with a template is much easier to start your presentation
- Here you don't have to worry about dependencies, deployment and how to generate a PDF
